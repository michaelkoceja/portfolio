        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <div class="well">
            <p>Hi, my name is Michael Koceja. I'm 23 years old and currently have lived in Vancouver, WA for the last 13 years. Originally, im from San-Diego, CA. I'm a <strong>huge</strong> soccer fan and have played since I was 4 years old. I also ran cross country all 4 years of highschool. Currently, my favorite team is Real Madrid. My favorite player is Mesut Ozil. I think he is one of the <em>best</em> attacking mids in the game. I was fortunate to be talented enough to play college ball. While I've always enjoyed being competitve in sports, I've also greatly enjoyed computers from a young age. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends having a beer, listening to and playing music, and playing wth my puppy. And of course, sitting at my computer doing whatever it may be.

          <h2>My Background</h2>
            <div class="well">
              <p><span>I grew up really disliking school</span>. While I enjoy learning, I've never been a fan of a class room. I sort of went through the motions growing up. Not really caring or putting extra effort. I still got good grades but I never did anything like my best friends did. I graduated highschool and went to college, like every kid is "supposed" to do. At the time I wanted to be a doctor. I lasted 2 years and came home. I worked as a cook at Buffalo Wild Wings for a bit and quit. I got another job at the airport working on the plane catering service. I quit after a few months. I then lived at my parents house sort of, "bumming" it for a while. I then got hired as a cad-cam tech at Qualident Dental Lab. After about a month I was the lead technician for the remander of my time there, about 2 and a half years. I then quit to start my journey in web-development at Epicodus.
