    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Michael Koceja. I'm 23 years old and currently have lived in Vancouver, WA for the last 13 years. Originally, im from San-Diego, CA. I'm a huge soccer fan and have played since i was 4 years old. I was fortunate to be talented enough to play college ball. While I've always enjoyed being competitve in sports, I've also greatly enjoyed computers from a young age. I always thought building a career in web-development would be interesting. My high school web-design class sort of set me in the right direction. I'm not a fan on traditional school so I left college after only 2 years. I worked some real crummy jobs for about a year and a half. I then found a more perminate job working as a cad-cam technician at a dental lab (I made teeth for people on a computer.) I was there for nearly two years and I was ready to be done. It was a good time to leave and start my journey in web-development with Epicodus. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends having a beer, listening and playing music, and playing wth my puppy.</p>
